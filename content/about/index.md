title: About Me

Sentient Potato is a pseudonym to allow me to have an anonymous online presence,
largely to avoid outing myself as a bisexual to colleagues and family members.
I am a socially progressive Christian and amateur theologian.
Many think Christianity only supports conservative views on social issues.
While I was raised as a socially conservative evangelical,
I believe the Good News of Christ offers more support to progressive stances.
My blog "This is The Way" outlines my thinking on theology,
often as it relates to social issues.
I am *not* an expert or have a seminary degree;
these posts just reflect my best attempt to make sense of God's will for us
in our current societal context.

I am also a political science PhD student who studies American political institutions.
While "This is The Way" is my main focus here at The Potato Patch,
from time to time I'll also add posts on political science topics.
